The idea for this project is to create a webpage showcasing my previous projects and introducing myself, this website will be used alongside my cv/cover letter/linkedin to help towards finding a job.

As of yet I have no solid idea of how the website should look but it will consist of:
* Landing Page
* About Page
* Project Page - showcasing all the projects I've done
* Project details page - detailed explanation of each project with links and screenshots
* Contact Page - this could contain my personal contact information or a form users can submit
* Additional information - hobby/interests/goals

Firstly I will create some basic wireframes so I have a basic idea of how each page should look, once this is done I will then move onto creating the basic application and going through one page at a time.
