The idea for this project is to create a webpage showcasing my previous projects and introducing myself.

As of yet I have no solid idea of how the website should look but it will consist of:
* Landing Page - Welcome text + background image
* About Page - About me as a developer
* Project Page - showcasing all the projects I've done
* Project details page - detailed explanation of each project with links and screenshots
* Contact Page - this could contain my personal contact information or a form users can submit
* Additional information - hobby/interests/goals

Firstly I will create some basic wireframes so I have a basic idea of how each page should look, once this is done I will then move onto creating the basic application and going through one page at a time.
